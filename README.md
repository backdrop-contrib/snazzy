# Snazzy

Stylish modern theme with Color module support.

## Installation

- Install this theme using the official [Backdrop CMS instructions](https://backdropcms.org/guide/themes)

## Configuration

On larger screens Snazzy puts the "Header" region and the "Top" region side by side.
Note that the "Top" region is supposed to contain a single hero block.
If you do not want that "split header", you can turn it off on the theme's settings page
(admin/appearance/settings/snazzy). Just uncheck the "Front page header split" option and save.

In flexible layout templates, Snazzy get's the next region right after the header to create the "split header".

If the Color module is enabled, you can choose between three color presets or create a custom one.
